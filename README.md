# Disciple.Tools - Advanced M2M Tiles

The Advanced M2M Tiles plugin is a collection of tools to help Media2Movement efforts that use an access strategy to find
seekers and connect them with disciple making multipliers. The main tile tool is one for the dispatcher who attempts to connect
the new contact with a disciple maker.
